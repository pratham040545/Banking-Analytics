# Banking-Analytics

##  Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a basic understanding of **risk analytics** in banking and financial services, focusing on how data can be used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

By leveraging **Python, SQL, and Power BI**, we aim to help financial institutions make data-driven decisions â€” such as assessing an applicantâ€™s likelihood of repaying a loan and deciding whether to approve or reject the application.


##  Solution
Our **Banking Dashboard** provides an intuitive, interactive interface to analyze client profiles and financial behaviors.  
Key decision-making insights include:
- Predicting the likelihood of loan repayment.
- Identifying high-risk applicants.
- Monitoring customer relationships and investment details.

##  Dataset Information
The dataset contains:
- **Bank Details**
- **Client Information**

The dataset consists of multiple tables linked through **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.

**Tables include:**
1. **Banking Relationship**
2. **Client-Banking**
3. **Gender**
4. **Investment Advisor**
5. **Period**


## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **Python** â€“ Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA.
- **SQL** â€“ Data extraction and integration.
- **Power BI** â€“ Data visualization and dashboard creation.


##  Workflow
1. **Data Extraction**: Pulling relevant data using SQL queries.
2. **Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to explore patterns, trends, and anomalies.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Designing a Power BI dashboard to display actionable insights.


##  Use Case
Financial institutions can use this dashboard to:
- Assess risk before lending.
- Make informed loan approval decisions.
- Track customer financial relationships.
